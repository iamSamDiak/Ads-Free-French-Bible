## Bible Louis Segond Version

App ads-free I made to read the Bible:
I used Ionic to make this one.
This repo contains an .apk and .ipa file (and some junk as well ^^")
### Also: 
It contains .py files for the scraping of the chapters, the verses, and the export of a .json file and the .txt files containing the full content of each chapter by book.
### How to run it:
Clone this repo and run `npm install` then `ionic serve` (ionic has to be install) or you can install the app manually according of your device by downloading the releases.
